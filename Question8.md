# Question 8

## The New System

First to address is the differences this new system would actually cause. Adding 2 in each league in postseason wouldn't actually change too much for many teams. Teams that wouldn't have had bye rounds, will still have the same exact number of series with the same number of games. The biggest difference this system would have is the fact that it can be assumed that now no teams would receive bye rounds, and instead the 1 seed in each league would directly play the 8th seed in the first round.

## Changes to team

With all teams required to participate in short game series in the first round, I would definitely focus on having a couple star players on the roster. This way these shorter series can be controlled and dominated by these highly valued players. Team depth will be more important in later series but making it through these early series without going to game 3 or game 5 in round 2 will definitley benefit the team in the long run. Outside of these star players, due to the fact that the top 8 teams would make it to the post-season over just the top 6, teams could focus a little more on development of players in the normal season, as there would be a greater chance for them to make the post-season. This development of younger less valuable players would both save teams money and increase their team depth going into the post-season. Increasing pitcher depth would also help with the extra games 1 and 2 seeds would now need to face, as being able to rotate in many pitchers would definitely benefit teams in the longer post-season.
